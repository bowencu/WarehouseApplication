# Marketplace Store
### CPSC-210 Project by Bowen Cui

## Description
This application aims to produce similar functionality as an online shopping marketplace. The features provided aim 
to fit both seller's and buyer's needs alike. Products that are uploaded can include various types and features that a seller may wish to advertise. A buyer has options to browse 
products according to their needs, such as filtering for a specific category or sorting products according to price. This idea was of interest to me because shopping can be a frustrating experience for customers, especially 
as online marketplaces are increasingly common. The process of finding the right product can be made easy for the 
customer by implementing ways for one to express their criteria through their browsing experience.

**As a user, I want to be able to:**
- sell products by uploading product details to the database
- include details on a products for sale *(name, price, sale price, category, used condition, description, etc.)*
- view all products currently for sale
- filter and sort products according to their features *(name, price, sale price, category, used condition, description, etc.)*
- buy products and add them to my personal inventory
- have an account that stores my remaining balance for purchases on this application
- apply discounts to all currently listed products during promotional events, or only to products that fit a specified 
  criteria
