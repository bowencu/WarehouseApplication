# Marketplace Store
### CPSC-210 Project by Bowen Cui

## Description
This application aims to produce similar functionality as an online shopping marketplace. The features provided aim 
to fit both seller's and buyer's needs alike. Products that are uploaded can include various types and features that a seller may wish to advertise. A buyer has options to browse 
products according to their needs, such as filtering for a specific category or sorting products according to price. 
When a purchase is made, the price paid by the buyer goes into the seller's account balance. This idea was of interest 
to me because 
shopping can be a frustrating experience for 
customers, especially 
as online marketplaces are increasingly common. The process of finding the right product can be made easy for the 
customer by implementing ways for one to express their criteria through their browsing experience.

  criteria
