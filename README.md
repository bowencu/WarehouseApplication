# Buy And Sell Cars
### CPSC-210 Project by Bowen Cui

## Description
This application aims to produce similar functionality as an online car dealership or an online vehicle marketplace, 
such as AutoTrader. The features provided aim to fit both seller's and buyer's needs alike. Vehicles that are 
uploaded can include various types and features that a seller may wish to advertise. A buyer has options to browse 
vehicles according to their needs, such as filtering for a specific model or sorting vehicles according to price 
or age. This idea was of interest to me because shopping can be a frustrating experience for customers, especially 
as online marketplaces are increasingly common. The process of finding the right product can be made easy for the 
customer by implementing ways for one to express their criteria through their browsing experience.

**As a user, I want to be able to:**
- sell vehicles by uploading vehicles to the database
- include details on a vehicle for sale *(price, age, model, colour, etc.)*
- view all vehicles currently for sale
- filter and sort vehicles according to their features *(price, age, model, colour, etc.)*
- buy vehicles and add them to my personal inventory
- have an account that stores my remaining balance to purchase vehicles on this application
- apply discounts to all currently listed vehicles during promotional events
